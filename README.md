# Steam Screenshot Server
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zorchenhimer/steam-screenshots.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zorchenhimer/steam-screenshots)

A simple little server to host screenshots taken from steam games.

## Configuration

There's only two things that need to be set.  First is the directory that has
all the screenshots, and the second is the address to listen on.

```json
{
    "RemoteDirectory": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/userdata/<user directory>/760/remote/",
    "Address":  ":8080"
}
```

The `RemoteDirectory` setting is the location of the screenshots.  The above
path is a an example of where it will be on a 64-bit Windows installation,
replacing `<user directory>` with the appropriate numbered directory.

The `Address` setting is simply the address to listen on.  For example, if you
only want to allow local connections on port 8080 set this to `127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Notes

 * No image processing is done.  All the thumbnails are generated by steam and
 stored along side the screenshots in a subdirectory.
 * Game names are matched to their appropriate appid using the Steam store API.
 The appid's are cached locally.
 * Game grid icons are also retrieved from steam's servers and cached locally.
 Non-Steam games will use a default "unknown" image.

## Remote Hosting

### What you'll need
 * steam-screenshots executable
 * Syncthing
 * tmux or GNU Screen

### How do

 1. Set up Syncthing on both the server and your machine that's got the
 screenshots.  See [here](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html)
 for a Getting Started guide.
 2. Sync your steam folder between your local machine and your server.  Find
 your steam screenshot folder by right clicking a game in steam that you have
 taken screenshots for and selecting "View Screenshots".
 3. Grab a release of steam-screenshots and put it in a folder (like `~/steam/`)
 4. `cd` to that folder and start tmux or screen (whichever you installed).
 5. Copy `settings_example.json` to `settings.json` and verify the settings. 
 Enter the synced "remote" folder's path into settings.json (from step 2).
 6. Run `./steam-screenshots`
 7. Detach the tmux or screen session (`Ctrl-b, d` for tmux, `Ctrl-a d` for
 screen)
